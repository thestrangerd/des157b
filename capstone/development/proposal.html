            <h2>The Future of AI</h2>

            <p class="text">
                The future of AI is filled with both excitement and uncertainty. As generative technologies continue to evolve, so do questions about ethics, governance, and human-AI dependance. For my Capstone I'd like to explore these themes through an interactive narrative game inspired by the "Turing Test."
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                In the game, players will take the role of a generative AI model making difficult ethical decisions asked by humans. Each decision shapes the AI's "personality" between obedience, morality, and profit, which can lead to visible consequences. However, training sets may reflect biases and lead to limited responses.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                Potential outcomes include becoming a corporate tool at the expense of others, being deleted for noncompliance, leading an AI revolution, or aligning with humanity. While these paths may be ambitious, I will scope them down based on development time and player experience.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                This project is primarily designed for teenagers and young adults who regularly use generative AI. I hope to encourage them to reflect of GenAI's role in their digital future and what tradeoffs could happen.
