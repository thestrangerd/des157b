            <h2>Observations</h2>

            <p class="text">
                When user testing, the user found the tasks quite straightforward, despite the instructions not being direct. The three tasks were to mute white noise, discover one library used, and start the simulation. 
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                As I observed without speaking, I noticed the user enjoyed the clicking sound a lot and kept clicking at random non-button locations. When completing the first task to mute white noise, they directly moved to the settings. Similarly, when finding a library, they clicked on the credits. However, when tasked to start the simulation, they clicked a few times on the "JUDGMENT" wallpaper background before clicking on the "JUDGMENT" icon.
            </p>

            <h2>Questions</h2>

            <p class="text">
                Once they completed all three tasks, I asked the following questions:
            </p>

            <ul class="text">
                <li>How did you feel while navigating the website?</li>
                <li>How did you know where to go for each task? What elements helped you?</li>
                <li>What could make it easier for you to navigate each task?</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text">
                Majority of the feedback was positive. The tasks were intuitive and easy to find and the atmosphere and sound effects felt immersive. The main difficulty was understanding the smiley icon was the start button. Like the settings and the credits, the user believed it was to reveal more info about the game, not to start the simulation. They initially thought the screen was the start screen of a game and to begin the simulation, they had to click the large "JUDGMENT" in the center. However, they also specified that after a couple clicks they realized the icon was the start, as it was the last (other) option on the screen.
            </p>

            <h2>Changes</h2>

            <p class="text">
                The user test was very helpful. Thankfully I was already on the right track and the atmosphere and usability is quite straightforward thus far. Unfortunately, I did not have my main simulation ready yet so that will be my main focus moving forward. 
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                To remedy the start button issue, I will either remove the large "JUDGMENT" wallpaper or indicate the icon starts either via instructions or renaming the JUDGMENT application. However, as of now, the main concern is finishing the game.
