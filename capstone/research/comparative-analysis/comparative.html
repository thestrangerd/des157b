            <p class="text">
                <a href="https://www.moralmachine.net/">Moral Machine</a> is an online experiment studying human perspectives on machine ethics, particularly with self-driving cars. A similar comparison is that of the Trolley Problem, another ethical decision-based game where users must choose between who to save and who to sacrifice.
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                The test consists of thirteen key decisions, each with two clear images killing the left side or right side. Each dilemma always includes at least one death, whether it is a pedestrian or the passengers. 
            </p>

            <p class="text">
                What makes Moral Machine interesting are its direct categorizations. For example, it might directly pit male against female, homeless against executives, or children against elderly, etc. Having such clear-cut generalizations allow for more personal biases to upend themselves, and these biases may reflect in the data often fed to AI. However, it is intriguing to think: in this situation, what would a self-driving car actually do?

            <h2>#2 Qualia</h2>

            <p class="text">
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3351080/qualia/">Qualia</a> is an introspective and philosophical text-based narrative game (FREE on Steam) that brilliantly explores what it means to be alive. The user plays as a volunteer for an AI company called Intellica, chosen to classify participant answers as Human or Artificial. However, what initially starts as a Turing-esque test, quickly evolves into an eerie `experience on identity and how we differ from the things we create.

            <p class="text">
                After playing for five hours and discovering all six endings, I believe this game introduces a plethora of fascinating questions regarding consciousness, emotions, and the "torturing" of AI in training. What makes it especially unique is how it portrays AI in a grey light, rather than "good" or "bad."
